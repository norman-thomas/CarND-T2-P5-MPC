# Rubric Questions

## The Model
> Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.


## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
> Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.


## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
> A polynomial is fitted to waypoints.
> If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.


## Model Predictive Control with Latency
> The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.
